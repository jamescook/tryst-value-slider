# Dev/test image for tryst-value-slider. Built from this repo's own root as
# context - both tryst and tryst-vector are `github:` shard dependencies
# (their own repos), so `shards install` fetches them directly rather
# than needing them copied into the build context.
#
# Debian forky for the same reason tryst-vector/Dockerfile is: it's the
# first Debian release carrying libthorvg-dev, which this shard also
# links (it renders through tryst-vector's Surface).
#
# Must be run as `docker run --rm --init <image>` - same requirement as
# every other Dockerfile in this repo. Without --init, xvfb-run hangs
# forever as PID 1.
