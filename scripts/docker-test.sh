# Builds the tryst-value-slider Docker test image and runs its spec
# suite (see ../Dockerfile), then cleans up the dangling images repeated
# builds leave behind. Labeled so cleanup only ever touches this image.
#
# The build context is the REPO ROOT, not this shard's directory: this
# shard depends on both tryst (path: ../) and tryst-vector
# (path: ../tryst-vector), so both have to be reachable from the
# context. Run it from anywhere.
#
# Any arguments are passed straight through to `crystal spec` inside the
# container, so a focused run works here as well as on the host:
#
#   tryst-value-slider/scripts/docker-test.sh                          # everything
#   tryst-value-slider/scripts/docker-test.sh spec/tryst/value_slider_spec.cr  # one file
